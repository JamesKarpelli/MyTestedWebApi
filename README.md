MyTested.WebApi Samples
====================================

Here you can find couple of working samples, which will get you started with the library. Currently added:

 - Books Web API - minimalistic sample showing how to use MyTested.WebApi for unit testing controllers and routes as well as run full integration testing over in-memory OWIN web server for anonymous and authorized requests. The web project uses Ninject as dependency resolver, AutoMapper to map different kind of models and NUnit as testing framework. It should be enough to get you started.
 - Source Control System API - another minimalistic sample using AutoFac as dependency resolver. Has controller, route and OWIN integration tests with tested server response time. Uses Microsoft Visual Studio Test Tools.
